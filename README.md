# AI-ML-DS-Projects
This repository contains various projects related to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science (DS). Each project includes a well-documented implementation, dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

ðŸ“Œ Projects Overview

# Car Price Prediction

Description: Predicts the price of used cars using Linear Regression.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Gradio

Features: Data preprocessing, correlation analysis, visualization, model evaluation

# House Price Prediction (Karachi Dataset)

Description: Predicts house prices based on Karachi real estate data using Linear Regression.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib,Scikit-learn

Features: Data cleaning, feature engineering, regression modeling, interactive UI with Gradio

# Cat vs Dog Classification 

Description: This project classifies images of cats and dogs using a deep learning model. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve accurate classification between the two categories.

Tech Stack: Python TensorFlow/Keras Pandas Matplotlib OpenCV (Optional for image preprocessing)

Features: Data preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation), CNN model implementation Model training and evaluation, Visualization of training performance (loss & accuracy plots)
and Prediction on new images
